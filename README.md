# hello-world
Just another repository

This is a story all about how
My world got flipped, tyrned upside down
So I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the Fresh Prince of Bel Air

In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school

When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
